Hi,

I'm Sean Macdonald. 
I'm interested in infrastructure and application architecture.
I'm currently reading [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) for the 3rd time.
I'm looking to collaborate on interesting solutions to hard problems.
You can reach me at hello@seanmacdonald.ca

This README will be updated when I have some more time. In the meantime, please check out https://seanmacdonald.ca for a curated view of some of my projects
