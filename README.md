Hi,

I'm Sean Macdonald. 

I like working with code and infrastructure.

I'm currently building a consensus protocol in Go. It aims to offer better scalability and convergence properties than Paxos and Raft. It does so by borrowing ideas from anthropology.

I'm looking to collaborate on interesting solutions to hard problems.

You can reach me at hello at myname dot ca

This README will be updated when I have some more time. In the meantime, please check out https://seanmacdonald.ca for a curated view of some of my projects
