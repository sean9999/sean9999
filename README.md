ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sean from Canada ðŸš€. I enjoy hacking in Go, Python, Bash, and Rust. I am especially passionate about cloud infrastruture, distributed systems, and open source.

I work as Backend Go developer at [Hard Rock Digital](https://www.hardrockdigital.com/).

I have hobbies other than software engineering, but I can't remember what they are at the moment. Still, I would like it if you thought of me as a well-rounded individual.
